# FEUP-LAIG
Project 1 - Graphical engine that reads an XML file specifying the scene to render. A tree is constructed based on the scene language specification, which allows for the recursive and fault-tolerant parsing of the scene file.
Features include: Geometrical Transformations, textures, materials, animations and shaders.
Primitives: triangle, rectangle, cylinder, sphere, plane, NURBS surface, terrain.
The scene itself is represented as a graph where nodes apply transformations, materials, textures and animations to their children.
Languages: Javascript and GLSL
Technologies: WebGL
